This is a personal repo for working through the excellent [Discover Three.js Book](https://discoverthreejs.com).

It's a work in progress.

The spinning cube and animated birds are very fun animations, but the real value of the book, in my view, is the detailed coverage of best practices and project setup for working with Three.js. 

As such, I may be interested in fleshing this repo out even more in the near future and turning it into a template repository for future projects.
